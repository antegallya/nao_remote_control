Simple and (really) dirty joystick controller for Nao using pygame
==================================================================

Put your axis/buttons configuration in joy_conf.py. There are examples in
joy_conf_ps4.py and joy_conf_xbox.py.

Usage: main.py <IP> <joy_id>

There is also a "chatter" script :
Usage: chat.py <IP> [port]

It replicates lines on stdin to speech synthesis on the robot.
